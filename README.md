1. Header Section
a. A search bar for searching products.
b. Icons for profile and cart.
2. Product List Section:
a. Display a grid/list of products based on the Figma design.
b. Each product card should include:
i. Product Image
ii. Product Name
iii. Price
iv. "View Product" and "Add to Cart" buttons.
c. Clicking "View Product" should redirect the user to a custom
"Thank You" page. There will be no product details page, so you
are required to design a Thank You page from scratch.

3. Add to Cart Modal:
a. Clicking “Add to Cart” on any product should open a modal that
displays the product’s details and an option to confirm adding the
product to the cart.
b. The modal design is included in the Figma file and should be
closely followed.

4. Pagination:
a. Implement pagination to navigate through multiple product
listings (functional but mock data is acceptable).

5. Thank You Page:
a. Create a simple "Thank You" page to which users are redirected
after clicking "View Product". This page should acknowledge their
action with a simple message (e.g., "Thank you for your interest in
[Product Name]!").
